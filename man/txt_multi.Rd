\title{Split a String into Multiple Substrings by Newline Characters}
\usage{
txt_multi(x, new_line = "\\n")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character string to be split.}

\item{new_line}{The newline character used for splitting the string.
Defaults to `'\\n'`.}
}
\value{
A character vector where each element is a substring resulting from the split.
}
\description{
Splits a string into multiple substrings based on newline characters.
}
\details{
This function takes a character string and splits it into a vector of substrings,
using a specified newline character as the delimiter.

The function uses `stringr::str_split()` to split the input string `x` by the
  `new_line` character.  The resulting list is then unlisted into a character vector.
  This is useful for processing text data where you need to handle multiple lines
  within a single string. The default newline character is `'\\n'`.
}
\examples{
# Basic usage with default newline character
\dontrun{
txt_multi("line1\nline2\nline3")

# Using a different newline character (e.g., carriage return)
txt_multi("line1\rline2\rline3", new_line = "\r")

# Handling a single line string
txt_multi("line1")


# Example with mixed newline characters (requires additional cleaning)
mixed_text <- "line1\r\nline2\nline3"
# To handle mixed newlines, you might need to replace \r\n with \n first
cleaned_text <- stringr::str_replace_all(mixed_text, "\r\n", "\n")
txt_multi(cleaned_text)
}
}
