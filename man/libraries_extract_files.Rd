\title{Extract Required Libraries from R Files in a Directory}
\usage{
libraries_extract_files(
  dir = file.path(here::here(), "R"),
  pattern = "\\\\.R$"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{character. The directory to search for R files. Defaults to the 'R' subdirectory of the project root (using `here::here()`).}

\item{pattern}{character. A regular expression pattern to match R files. Defaults to "\\.R$".}
}
\value{
character. A character vector containing the unique names of all libraries required by the R files in the specified directory.
}
\description{
Extracts library names from R files in a directory.
}
\details{
This function extracts the names of required R libraries from all R files within a specified directory.

This function recursively searches for R files (defaulting to files ending with ".R") within a given directory. It then uses `libraries_extract_file` to extract library names from each file. The results are combined, duplicates are removed, and a vector of unique library names is returned.  It leverages `list.files` for file discovery and `purrr::map` for applying `libraries_extract_file` to each file.

\dontrun{
# Extract libraries from the default 'R' directory
libraries <- libraries_extract_files()

# Extract libraries from a specific directory with a custom pattern
libraries <- libraries_extract_files(dir = "path/to/my/R/files", pattern = "\\\\.r$")
print(libraries)
