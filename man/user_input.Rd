}
\arguments{
\item{questions}{A non-empty list of questions. Each element should be:
- a character string (label for a text input), or
- a list with at least a `question` field (character), and optionally
  a `choices` field (vector of choices for a dropdown input).}

\item{dialogName}{Title of the dialog window (default: "Questions.").}

\item{width}{Width of the dialog window in pixels (default: 10).}

\item{height}{Height of the dialog window in pixels (default: 10).}
}

  the questions or their labels. Returns `NULL` if the user cancels.
}
\description{
This function displays a miniUI dialog using Shiny's gadget framework,
dynamically generating input fields based on a list of questions. Each
question can be a simple string (which becomes a text input), or a list
with a `question` string and optional `choices` vector (which becomes
a dropdown if choices are present).
}
\examples{
questions <- list(
  "Enter your name:",
  list(question = "Choose a color:", choices = c("Red", "Green", "Blue")),
  list(question = "Comments?")
)
responses <- user_input(questions)


questions <- list(
  "What's your name?",
  list(question = "Do you want to include fries with that?", type = "logical"),
  list(question = "Choose a drink:", choices = c("Water", "Soda", "Juice")),
  list(question = "Rate our service (1-10):", type = "numericRange", range = c(1, 10)),
  list(question = "Any other comments?")
)

responses <- user_input(questions)
