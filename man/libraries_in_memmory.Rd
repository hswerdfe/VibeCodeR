\title{List Packages Loaded in Memory}
\usage{
libraries_in_memmory(package_prefix = "^package:")
}
\arguments{
\item{package_prefix}{}
}
\value{
character A character vector containing the names of all packages currently loaded in memory.
}
\description{
Returns a character vector of loaded package names.
}
\details{
This function identifies and lists all packages currently loaded in the R environment.

The function achieves this by examining the search path and extracting entries that begin with "package:". It then removes the "package:" prefix to return a clean list of package names. This is useful for determining which packages are actively available for use without explicitly listing them in the code.

\dontrun{
# List all packages currently loaded

# Check if a specific package is loaded

  print("dplyr is loaded.")
} else {
  print("dplyr is not loaded.")
