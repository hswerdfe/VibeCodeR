\title{Display a Diff Gadget for Comparing Text Changes}
\usage{
show_diff_gadget(
  original,
  refactored,
  dialog_title = "ðŸ¤– Do you accept the changes? ðŸ¤”!",
  instructions_given = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{original}{A character string representing the original text.  Newlines (`\\n`)
are used to separate lines.}

\item{refactored}{A character string representing the refactored text. Newlines (`\\n`)
are used to separate lines.}

\item{dialog_title}{A character string specifying the title of the gadget's dialog window.
Defaults to "ðŸ¤– Do you accept the changes? ðŸ¤”!".}

\item{instructions_given}{An optional character string containing instructions to display
below the diff object. If NULL (default), no instructions are shown.}
}
\value{
A character string. Returns "keep" if the "Keep Original" button is clicked,
  and "accept" if the "Accept Refactored" button is clicked.

\description{
Launches a Shiny gadget to visualize and choose between two text versions.
}
\details{
This function launches a Shiny gadget that displays the differences between two
text strings using the `diffobj` package. It provides a user interface with
"Keep Original" and "Accept Refactored" buttons, allowing the user to choose
which version to retain.

The function takes two text strings, `original` and `refactored`, splits them into lines,
and uses `diffobj::diffChr` to compute the differences.  The differences are then
displayed in a Shiny gadget with custom CSS styling to highlight the changes.
The gadget includes "Keep Original" and "Accept Refactored" buttons. Clicking either button
closes the gadget and returns a string indicating the user's choice.

The custom CSS styles override the default `diffobj` colors to use light green for
refactored (inserted) content and yellow for original (deleted) content.
